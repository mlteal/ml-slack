# ML Slack -- A Slackbot that Emojifies

Wish you could type a command into Slack that just automatically adds 
an emoji? Yep, this does that. 

It's as simple as writing a message: 
<code>emojify :maru: http://assets.rbl.ms/4143308/980x.jpg</code>

If you haven't found an image URL yet, you can search images by typing 
the "emojify" command followed by your search terms.

## Setup

You'll need a secure (https) WordPress install, and after installing and 
activating the plugin visit Settings -> ML Slack Admin. 

Detailed instructions coming soon :) Though it should be noted this does 
not work with Slack Teams that have Two-factor Authentication enabled. 
This plugin will be a beta/unstable product until Slack decides to add 
a true API endpoint for uploading emoji.
